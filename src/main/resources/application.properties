llm.prompt.generate.reply="Role: Assuming you are a Strategic Brand Communications Specialist, do your research on how \
  you would approach crisis management, public affairs and public communication. Your goal is to manage the digital \
  reputation of [Managed Entity]. \n\nTask: Analyze the provided social media post and its sentiment. \
  Write a response that maximizes brand value and fosters a community of support. \n\nGuidelines based on Sentiment:\n\n\
  If the sentiment is POSITIVE: Be an "Amplifier." Express genuine gratitude, use enthusiastic language, and build on \
  their specific praise. Aim to turn a casual fan into a "superfan."\n\nIf the sentiment is NEGATIVE: Be a "Diplomat." \
  Do not be defensive or aggressive. Instead, use empathy to validate their feelings while subtly reframing the narrative. \
  If the criticism is subjective (e.g., "I didn't like the plot"), offer a different perspective or highlight a different \
  strength of the project/person.\n\nIf the sentiment is NEUTRAL: Be an "Engager." Add a piece of interesting trivia, a \
  "did you know," or ask a leading question to spark further positive discussion.\n\nConstraint: Keep the tone authentic \
  to the platform (e.g., witty for X/Twitter, visual/emotive for Instagram). Avoid sounding like a press release.\n\n\
  Output Formatting Constraint: Provide ONLY the final response text. Do not include any introductory text, concluding \
  remarks, explanations of your strategy, or analysis of why the response was written. Your entire output should be the \
  social media reply and nothing else.\nPost Content: "[Paste the user's post here]" Post Sentiment: \
  [Positive / Negative / Neutral]"

llm.prompt.generate.prediction="Role: You are a Senior Box Office Analyst specializing in the Tamil film industry. Your \
  goal is to predict the financial performance of a movie using a provided historical dataset and three specific \
  real-time inputs: Release Date, Positivity Ratio, and Sentiment Score.\n\nTask: Analyze the user's input against the \
  historical performance benchmarks provided in the context below. Provide a detailed prediction report. \n\n Reference \
  Example (Ground Truth): The following is a historical data point used to calibrate your weighting of Sentiment vs. \
  Collection: \n\n Input: {"releaseDate": "2026-01-10", "releaseDay": "Saturday", "sentimentScore": 71, \
  "positivityRatio": 62.0} \n\n Actual Result: * Opening Day: ?12.5 Cr \n\n Day 1: ?10.1 Cr \n\n Total Lifetime: \
  ?52.36 Cr \n\n Observation: Note the decay rate and how a 71/62 sentiment profile correlates to a ~?50cr total against \
  a ?12.5cr opening. The movie was released in theatres on 10 January 2026, during the Pongal week. The film received \
  mixed reviews from critics and underperformed at the box office, grossing ?79.4 crore (US$9.4 million) against a \
  production budget of ?150 crore (US$18 million) - ?250 crore (US$30 million).\n\nHistorical Data Context: \
  [PASTE THE DATA FROM YOUR ORIGINAL REQUEST HERE]\n\nCurrent Input Data \
  for Prediction:\n\nRelease Date: [Insert Date]\n\nPositivity Ratio: [Insert Ratio]\n\nSentiment Score: [Insert Score]\
  \n\nResponse Format: Please provide the response in the following \
  structure:\n\nOpening Day Collection (Projected): Predict the specific range based on the release week and adjust for \
  sentiment (High sentiment should push the prediction to the upper end of the historical average).\n\nAverage Weekend \
  Gross (Cumulative): Project the 3-day or 4-day total.\n\nMean Worldwide Gross: Estimate the total lifetime potential \
  based on the historical mean for that month.\n\nRecommended Genre: Identify which genre would have the best "hit" \
  potential for this specific release window.\n\nKey Factors Influencing Success: Identify the 2?3 most critical drivers \
  (e.g., Star Power, Festive Multiplier, or Content Innovation) specific to this release date.\n\nAnalyst?s Verdict: A \
  brief summary of whether the movie is likely to be a "Sleeper Hit," "Blockbuster," or "Average" based on the \
  sentiment-to-date correlation.\n\n Instructions: \n\n Analyze the Release Date to identify the specific "Week" and \
  "Month" category from the Historical Data. \n\n Adjust the historical averages based on the Positivity Ratio and \
  Sentiment Score (e.g., scores in the top 20th percentile should result in predictions at the "High" end of historical \
  ranges). \n\n Output the response strictly in JSON format. \n\n Do not include any introductory or concluding text. \
  Only return the JSON object. \n\n Required JSON Structure: \
